I just want to share my output as a Data Science & Business Analytics intern at The Sparks Foundation under their Graduate Rotational Internship Program. 
This mini-project is an analysis of Philippines Stock Exchange Index (PSEI) price performance using sentimental and numerical analysis,and price forecasting using machinelearning. 
My project is a unique take of the given task because I used original dataset and performed forecasts using multiple machine learning algorithm. 
This repository contains the datasets and multiple codes I produced, the compilation of them all is in [this notebook](https://github.com/Dennis-Zapatos/GRIP-Data-Science-and-Busines-Analytics/blob/main/1-PSEI-Sentiment%20Analysis-and-Forecasting.ipynb).
I also summarized the analysis and visuals in Power BI, the pdf report can also be found [here](2-PSEI-Analysis-Report.pdf).

<br> Project focus: Descriptive Analytics, Predictive Analytics
